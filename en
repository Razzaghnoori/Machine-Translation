i had a choice between our family and paying them down .
were supposed to make decisions together .
would you have made anything different .
alice , we cant make it rain together turn the dust into grass .
we cant stop hollander from selling our land to the railroad either .
its too bad the doctors at the aid station didnt take much of my leg . i read that the pension act pays by the pound now .
stop looking at me like that .
are you going to tell the marshal what those men did .
marshal aint doing shit william .
first thing , mark . im going to take you boys . were going to round up the herd . then im going into town .
what are you going to do there .
im going to tell hollander to make this right .
im going to tell him to pay for a new barn .
maybe we should just shoot him like will says .
coach is headed for bigsby , boss .
girded with iron , on top , double shotguns . and a gatling .
you should have let me save the feed .
ar you going to hock that .
some day , william , .

byron mcelroy .
when did your hair turn gray , byron .
go to hell , ben wade .
well , will you look at all this . you all spared no expense this time , byron .
ive got to say , thought . its probably cheaper just to let me rob the damn thing .
if you are going to kill me , just as soon get to it .
i aint going to kill you .
not like this .
it wont change a thing , if you let me live .
ill come for you .
id be disappointed if you didnt .

hes fast .
well , tommy . it seems that there was a pinkerton inside that coach that wasnt quite dead .
now , i know what charlie told you , because we dont got but a few rules in this outfit .
this is what happens when you put us all at risk .

i dont need your cattle , but i will be needing them horses .
so you dont go doing nohing , foolish .
take the horse .
find them on the road to bigsby . boys .

pinkertons dont run late . thats why theyre paid 18 dollars a day .
get me on my feet .
i think youre in pretty bad shape , mr . just get me on my damned feet .
mark , williams , get me some of them boards .

i think maybe a coach headed for here got itself held up in a canyon about 10 miles back .
by mr ben wade himself .
how did you know it was wade .
its been him the last 21 times , marshal .
i saw a mexican sharpshooter and an apache .
did you see the hand of god whats that .

madame , some whisky for my friends .
lets go , the bar is closed .

proverbs 13:3 .
he that keepeth his mouth , keepeth his life . he that opens his lips too wide , shall bring about his own destruction .

mr . mcelroy , can you hear me it was ben wade .

this man needs attention .

i can turn the corner .
sometimes a man has to big enough to see how small he is .
railroad is coming , dan your land is worth more with you off it .
hollander .

how much do you get for a days work .
2 dollars , when i hire out .
there are 2 dollars for a halfday .

if you do that , everybody in this shit piss of a town will be dead by morning .
22 robberies , over 400 thousand dollars in losses more in delays .
the southern pacific will have ben wade convicted in a federal court . hanged .
in public , an example made .
and we will pay to make it happen .
you all notice he didnt mention of the lives ive taken .

madam .
byron , an unpleasant surprise .

well , you saw where his man was . hes still got to go fish the outfit . marshals got a fast rig , they should reach the fort before dawn .
his gang cant do anything in front of the whole sixth cavarly .
did you have something to do with that .
i hope you are proud of yourself .
just doing my job , doc .
thanks , son .
we always wait to say grace .
we dont presume to teach other people manners .
arent we supposed to say grace for murderers too .
grace is for everyone , dear then why dont we say it .
mark , id like to hear it .
god , our father , lord and savior thank you for your love and favor .
please bless this drink and food we pray and bless all who share with us today .
amen .
if my pa wanted to , he could shoot you dead he can shoot a jack rabbit at 50 yards .
shooting an animal is a lot different than shooting a man , son .
not , it isnt not in my opinion .
we can ask byron here . now byron , hes killed dozens of people . men and women and children . miners , apaches .
not a soul ive taken that didnt deserve what theyve got .
every way of a man is right in his own eyes , byron , but the lord ponders the heart .
proverbs 21 .
dan .
you eat more when youre nervous , mr butterfield .
could you cut that for me could you cut that fat out , i dont particularly like the fat at all .
allright .
and the grissle i dont like grissle .
do you mind if i ask you how you got that hitch in your step , dan .
dont tell him nothing , mr evans .
where were you stationed .
7th company of sharpshooters , out of massachusetts .
my father was defending the us capital in the district of columbia .
isnt that so well , dan . tell me the story of how you lost your leg .
did they shoot it off cut it off did the indians do it .
i saw something over there in the grass .
there aint nothing .
what if they caught up with the coach already what if they already know its crawley inside .
have you ever been to san francisco .
if its all right by you , mr . wade , i rather we not talk .
so youve never been in san francisco .
i know a girl there . shes the daughter of a sea captain .
she had the most beautiful green eyes .
the greenest eyes i ever saw .
like yours .
when i stared deep into them theyd just change color in front of me .
all the colors of the sea .
what did you say your name was again .
alice .
for gods sake , hes killed more men than the drought .
he is not what i expected .
he is dangerous dangerous is what he is , alice .
i dont want you or the boys talking to him .
you can change your mind , dan none will think less of you .
none can think less of me .
6 months from now , everything is going to be great .
cows are going to be fat .
we might even see the steam from the train coming over the ridge .
we will be allright , but we wont make it through the next 6 days , if i dont do this .
sorry , dan . mcelroy says 5 minutes .
do you think its too much for me .
hes a killer , daniel .
yet somehow i have the decency to bring him to justice .
what are you thinking .
i am not out there alone have a little faith in me .
ben wade has a gang and theyre out there tonight , somewhere .
if i dont go , we have to pack up and leave and god knows where w/o a prayer to .
now , i am tired , alice im tired of watching my boys go hungry .
im tired of the way they look at me im tired of the way that you dont .
ive been standing on one leg for 3 damned years , waiting for god to do me a favor .
and he aint listening .
mr . evans .
no , no , no . this is my horse now .
come over here .
dont give me any trouble , mark yes , sir .
boy .
i want to come with you well , you cant .
i can help .
youre 14 years old .
i can ride faster and you shoot better than any one of them .
the pinkerton is hurt , potter is no good , that railroad man is dead weight , and that other bastard .
i dont have time to argue i need you here .
thats that thats that .
so , boys , where are we headed .
it aint none of your business where we are headed , wade . youre a prisoner . you dont speak , you dont piss . you dont god damn breathe unless we say so .
do you understand that .
were taking you to contention putting you on the 3:10 to yuma , day after tomorrow .
you shouldnt have told him , now .
relax , friend . now if we get separated ill know where to meet up .
id like tol thank you for your hospitality , madame i hope i can send your husband back allright .
what did ben wade mean about sending pa back all right is he saying he was going to kill him .
ben wade dont have to lift a finger , his gang will do it for him .
your father can take care of himself .
so , were you conscripted into lincolns army , mr . evans or did you volunteered .
neither .
maybe both .
what does that means .
it means i was a volunteer for the massachusetts state guard then in 62 the federal government was running low on men so they called in the state militias .
to protect washinton . and thats when you got hurt .
what are you doing out here , dan youve got a family to protect .
you are not a law man , you dont work for the railroad like mr . shinny shoes over there .
not a pinkerton .
maybe i dont like the idea of men like you running loose .
its mans nature to take what he wants , dan .
its how we are born .
well , i make an honest living .
it might be honest , but i dont think its much of a living .
you must be hurting bad for money to take this job .
go to sleep .
i imagine debt puts a lot of pressure on a marriage .
are you married what would you know about marriage .
we cant all be cutthroats and thieves .
well , i know that if i was lucky enough to have a wife like alice , id treat her a whole lot better than you do , dan .
id feed her better , id buy her pretty dresses . i wouldnt make her work so hard .
yeah , id bet alice was a real pretty girl before she married you .
dont talk about my wife . you shut up about her . you say one more word and i cut your tongue .
id like the sight of it if you did .
its my watch , now .
i suppose its too much to ask for a little quiet .
the way i figured it: id be asleep in my own bed right now if it werent for you .
so if ive got to be up , you damn well be up with me too , .
son of a bitch .
enough .
enough thats enough , mcelroy .
we have to bury him .
if you take the time to dig one grave you might as well dig one for yourself .
lets go . mount up .
dont worry there , boss were going to get you out of there in a second .
wait wait .
no , no . dont do this .
dont do this . dont do this .
where is he .
open the door . open the door let me out of here , god damn it .
where did they take him .
i dont know .
mr . , youd better tell me where they took him .
or you will burn .
contention allright .
theyre going to contention .
theyre going to put him on the 3:10 to yuma prison . tomorrow .
let me go out of here .
contention is 80 miles back to the other way .
theyve just about killed our horses .
so , well buy new ones .
charlie , its his own fault he got caught he made a mistake .
you think you can do a better job leading this group .
maybe .
youve forgotten what he done for us .
were going to contention .
cant say i didnt warn you .
theres a shortcut we can take .
a shortcut .
through the pass .
it takes you right through contention .
why didnt you say something before .
its apache country .
i thought that the government gave them land . these are the ones who refused to go .
i wouldnt take that path you want us to take the long way .
thats right and let your boys catch us .
mr . butterfield , the apache who lived in that path are the ones that stayed to fight .
they enjoy killing .
you aint going to make it .
well take our chances .
something on your mind , dan .
why did you kill tucker .
why not me or butterfield .
hell , tucker took my horse .
did you liked him , dan no .
he told me he burned down your barn .
he was an asshole .
but wishing him dead and killing him are two different things .
your conscience is sensitive , dan .
i dont think its my favorite part of you .
, mr . wade . if you want to talk to somebody , talk to me .
i dont like talking to you , byron .
not when i have the gun .
no , that aint it . i just dont find you that interesting .
laugh it up , doc . till he guts you like a fish .
byron is like a song with one note .
did you ever read another book in your life , byron . besides the bible .
no need .
byron acts pius . a few years ago when he was under contract with central , .
ive seen him and a bunch of brother pinks .
mow down 32 apache women and children .
renegades . gunning down railroad men and their families .
picking them off the road , one by one . scalped .
there was youngnes running around . crying and screaming no more than 3 years old .
and his boys shot them all and pushed them into a ditch .
some of them were still crying .
i guess byron figured that jesus wouldnt mind .
apparently jesus dont like the apache .
keep on talking .
all the way to yuma . right up on them steps to the rope . straight to hell .
yeah , the day i die , byron .
im getting sprung from hell .
i might feel the same , if id come from the seed of a drunk grave digger and the rancid womb of a whore .
drop it , dan evans . drop it .
toss it to the ground , doc .
mr . butterfield .
i believe , dan , youre carrying a pistol as well . id appreciate it if you take it out and drop it on the ground . thank you .
now , ive always liked you , byron , .
, but you never knew when to shut up .
even bad men love their mommas .
now i think its time for everybody to go home .
dont you move , mr . wade .
let go of that shotgun .
william , what the hell are you doing here .
i dont think that youre going to shoot a man in the back of the head , boy .
dan , tell your boy its over .
you think you can keep you gun on him , william .
im doing a damn sight better than you did .
you ever been to dodge city .
stop talking to him .
the way youre shuffling those cards , i took you for a pro .
i practice a lot .
i can tell .
you ever been to dodge .
yes , indeed .
meanest , most beautiful , dirty city there ever was .
saloons just overflowing with cattle drivers and road agents , prospectors , gunslingers , gamblers and women .
women will do things to you youll never forget .
theyll give you disease youll never forget .
money in your pocket in dodge city you can have everything a man ever wished for .
everything a man comes to need .
i got i was a boy not much bigger than you .
now , how many men have you killed since then , wade .
how many families have you destroyed .
quite a few .
is it true that you dynamited a wagon full of prospectors in the western territories last spring .
no , thats a lie .
it was a train full .
i gotta take a piss .
you know , i thought he was going to shoot me back in the ravine .
i really thought he was going to do it .
there was a wildness in his eyes . he reminds me .
hes going to be nothing like you , wade .
a mans got to have a head start on the path of decency .
yeah , thats why i dont mess around with doing anything good , dan .
dou do one good deed for somebody .
i imagine its habit forming .
something decent . see that grateful look in their eyes .
i imagine it makes feel like christ hisself .
ive had enough of this , wade . come on . lets go .
its three of them yours .
if they were mine , youd be dead .
give me that gun , wade .
i told you not to come this way .
it was mcelroys decision .
i told you thered be trouble .
give me the keys to the handcuffs .
easy . easy now .
hes gone .
he took the horses with him . i found this in the grass .
thats the quickest way out of the pass hell be looking for help , to get his cuffs off .
we are going after him .
there aint no reward for getting him halfway to that train , is there .
ive got to be honest with you , i like some of their food .
as for wanting $40 a month now , i can .
hello , love .
god damned coolies . theyll work just fine with my left boot up their ass .
well , if i could teach a monkey to lay track , .
well . what we need here are some negros brought here , mister boles .
show these chinamen what real work is .
holly christ .
who is that .
thats him .
help me with the handcuffs .
break the chain . use the hammer . break the chain .
i have 5 guns on you out here , ben wade .
just come on out .
the horses .
what the hell is going on here .
mr . butterfield , all finished in bigsby .
mr . boles .
youd better hurry . were making the last blasts through the mountains this week .
thats my prisoner .
were taking him to contention , putting him on the prison train to yuma .
what prisoner .
come now , mr . boles . thats ben wade you have there .
ben wade gunned down my kid brother , .
in front of me , 6 years ago in abeline .
your brother was a lying card shark .
that is , if he is the asshole i remember . he could of course be some other asshole ive killed that ive forgot about .
you cant do that . thats immoral .
immoral aint got a damned thing to do with it .
i was expecting to collect a $200 reward for that man .
im delivering him to contention , i need that money .
need it bad enough to die .
at least let us take our horses .
ive got no problem with that .
as long as you ride away , mr .
nice knowing you , dan .
did we make it did we get away .
yeah , doc . we did .
thanks to you .
we need a place to lay low . keep him out of sight till the train comes .
there is a hotel up here , ill check to see , and you ride around back .
hey , will . you keep a watch on the rail head you see them coming .
ill let you know .
its the bridal suite , i hope you dont mind , its all they had .
well , well . that looks like rain clouds over bigsby .
you still need that $200 , dan .
shut up .
mr . evans , you continue to give me great confidence .
im going to see about the marshal .
were looking for a group escorting and outlaw by the name of ben wade .
yeah , weve been chasing them through these tunnels .
who you are .
whats it to you .
ben wade killed my brother .
then your brother must be famous .
are you , boys , some kind of posse .
i hate posses .
so this is the bridal suite .
now , i wonder how many brides have taken in this view .
what are you going to do with your $200 now , dan .
now that the rains are coming .
i owe people money , wade . that drought left me in the hole .
what do you think about double that amount .
you can pay your debts , buy a hundred more cows .
build a new barn .
how do you reckon im going to do that .
just lay down your gun and let me walk out the door . its worth $400 .
is that what you reckon my price is .
no , i reckon its a thousand one thousand dollars .
there was ten times that amount in butterfields coach .
do you want my cut , dan its all yours .
isnt that kind of reckless of you wade .
seeing that hmmm . youre so sure that your crew is coming to get you .
oh , theyre coming , dan .
sure as gods vengeance , theyre coming .
but i just like to do things easy .
imagine what you can do with $1000 , dan .
you can hire a couple of ranch hands . your boys could go to school , grow up smart .
what about alice .
she wouuld be the proud wife of a bonafide arizona rancher .
all youve got to do is say yes .
will you give me a bank note , wade or will you be kind enough to make a deposit for me .
cash .
you tell me , wade . how will i account for that amount of money .
what will i tell people when i spend it .
that you got the jump on me , you escaped , and somehow i got a fortune .
no . how dumb do you think people are .
nobody needs to know .
do you know what .
would you do me a favor .
dont talk to me for a while .
you mean were still not friends .
no . no , were not .
come 5 minutes to 3 , were going to be a hell of a lot closer than you think .
who is it .
its me , dan .
i brought help .
youve been gone for a long time , mr . butterfield .
how do i know someone aint got a gun on you out there .
dan , this is marshal will doane .
marshal mr . evans .
two of my finest men .
im sorry about all that , marshal , i am grateful for the help .
dont mention it .
so , you fellows are really going to help to put me on this train .
it might not seem like it , mr . wade , .
but we got law and order in this town , just like in any other .
well , thats very reassuring , marshal .
how much money is butterfield paying you .
thats not of your business .
youre coming with us .
every step of the way .
you have my word on that , dan .
that makes five of us . five is good .
it aint enough .
it aint nearly enough .
thats my boy .
theyre coming .
they are coming this way ive seen them where .
about a mile out , same way we come .
how many are they seven , eight .
which is it 7 or 8 .
seven .
folks , sorry to bother you , but im going to need you to move outside as quickly as possible .
thats it , folks . move along .
right there .
sure therere a lot of them youd figure , with it being the whole gang .
boss boss .
boss , are you are in there .
what do you want me to tell them .
you tell them youll write them a letter every day from yuma .
be careful , wade .
charlie , boys .
charlie , why dont you take the boys down to the saloon and boy them a drink .
are you ok .
i am fine . just sitting up here with my 4 new friends .
thats enough .
thank you , charlie .
listen up .
listen up .
thats ben wade they have up there .
now , the railroad intends .
to put him on the 3:10 to yuma and hang him .
whats he doing .
we will give you $300 cash .
to any man who shoots anyone of his captors .
$200 cash guaranteed .
$200 guaranteed .
ill take $200 give me the money .
youve got to shoot them first .
its gotta be 30 or 40 with guns out there now .
the hell with this .
now , just a minute , marshal .
now , look . if its a fair fight , sure . id stay for that . a fair fight .
thats a mans duty , but .
theres only 5 of us .
im sorry , mr , but im not going to die here today .
and neither are my men .

you forgot this .
now , you see , dan . generally , .
pretty much everyone .
. wants to live .
ill double your money .
lets go , boys .
please , do you want to see us shot down in the street .
this thing happened in bigsby .
that means butterfield too .
why bring your troubles to contention .

hes gona walk out on you .
then youd best get out like the rest of us .
hes not gonna come back up here hes gonna walk out on you .
now , what youve got to figure is why you and your boy are gonna die .
because of butterfields railroad loss of money .
theyre all of them .
almost .
your move , general .
what do you expect him to say .
i expect him to say something that makes sense .
something that might save the two of you .
take a look , dan whats the matter you dont want to see .
ill see them soon enough .
what about you , kid you wanna look .
stay away from the window , william .
go on take a look .
theyre animals all of them .
theyre gonna kill you and your father , william .

i think you know that .
call them them off .
why should i .
because youre not all bad .

your saved us from those indians . i saved myself .
you got us through the tunnels you helped us get away .
if i had a gun in them tunnels , i wouldve used it on you .
i dont believe you .
kid , i wouldnt last 5 minutes leading an outfit like that if i wasnt as rotten as hell .
dan , .
i cant do it , .
dan , and if i cant do it , you shouldnt do it either .
they say discretion is the better part of valor .
if you think that you have an olbigation to me or to the railroad .
i assure you you do not , im releasing you .
its just you left , dan . just you and your boy .
maybe he is right , pa , maybe we should go home .
what did doc potter gave his life for , william .
and mcelroy .
little red ants on a hill .
ill pay you the $200 , dan . right now . and you can walk away .
you know , this whole ride , its been nagging on me .
thats what the government gave me for my leg .
$198.36 and the funny thing is that .
when you think about it .
which i have been lately is that they werent paying me to walk away . they were paying me so they could walk away .
dont muddy the past on the present , dan .
no , no , no , wade . im seeing the world the way it is .
if you take him to the train , pa , im going with you .

im staying here with you .
youre going to hold up in the room across the hall . youre going to wait until we leave .
ill get him to bigsby . youve got my promise .
youre going to promise a lot more than that , butterfield .
i want guarantees that hollander and his boys will never set foot on my land again .
and that my water is going to flow . and i expect you to hand my wife $1000 cash when you see her . youve got money to spare .
i can deliver that , just get him on the train .
you heard him i heard him .
i want you to give this back to your mother .
i want you to tell her it helped me find what is right .
pa , i cant just leave you .
im going to be a day behind you , william unless something happens . and if it does , i need a man at the ranch .
to run things; to protect our family . and i know that you can do that because youve become a fine man , william .
youve become a fine man youve got all the best parts of me .
what few there are .
and you just remember that your old man hauled ben wade to that station when nobody else would .
you know , squeezing that watch wont stop time .
dont get so scared .
you might pack a bad mood .
ever read the bible , dan .
i read it one time . i was 8 years old . my daddy had just got himself killed over a shot of whiskey and my mom said we were going back east to start over .
so she gave me a bible , sat me down at the train station . told me to read it .
she was going to get our tickets .
well , i did what she said i read that bible cover to cover .
it took me 3 days .
she never came back .
its time .
its a half mile to the station from here , dan .
i guess were walking .
lucky .
youre not gonna get a chance to use those scofields , charlie .
perhaps you can explain to me the next portion of your plan , dan .
hey hey .

ayear younger than i was for my first .
when can i have a stag a stag .
come on tell me again what you said last week .
let that be a reminder to you .
i got it . i got it .
why would they join against the irish .
because someone has to stand up to them . you .
me , marke , all the tribes . we cant resist alone .
i could . my little warrior .
we have to be careful .
come home without something for your lady , youll have hell to pay .
can i of course you can , boy .
the angles have arrived , my lord .
as well as the celts , my fellow jutes and the saxons .
good . with marke .
well all be here . yeah . its a great day .
let us hope so . yeah .
thanks .
we heard the news . pray for a son .
mother . welcome to tantallon .
i made this for you .
friends .
look at us , the tribes of britain .
divided .
weak . just as the irish like us .
but if we were one land united .
we would outnumber them 2to1 .
we could defeat them once and for all . thats why were here today .
to sign this treaty of unification . who would be king .
the strongest among us .
lord marke .
look , if youre happy sending all your gold to ireland .
living as slaves , by all means , do nothing .
if we were happy doing that , we would never have risked coming here .
friends , my wife is with child . my heart tells me its a boy .
i want him to grow old in a land where all of us .
all the tribes pict .
celt , angle , jute , saxon are at peace .
this island has not known unity since the romans left .
that is why i sign this treaty .
and why should we follow you perhaps , wictred .
because your last attempt to form an alliance .
without the knowledge of half the barons in this room has failed .
alarm .
what for the irish are here .
take all your men , guard the women . but you wont have enough .
go .
quickly tristan back this way . hurry .
move down the ranks .
how did they know .
tristan no .
let me fight .
please , dont hurt him .
shes with the gods now , isolde . youll see her again someday .
will i .
morholt returns .
what news of the treaty .
good , morholt .
good .
your mother loved you so much , isolde .
why did she die , bragnae why .
it was an ill vapor that took her .
a fever .
no . it was her heart .
the irish have been here .
your husband .
oh . oh , sister , im so sorry .
the executions lasted a day .
they made sport of us .
a whole generation of men .
whos this .
tristan , son of aragon .
were his family now .
i have a son about your age .
melot . melot .
melot , this is tristan .
what shall we do , my lord .
rebuild .
three , four .
one , two dont hold back .
come on .
three , four .
tristan wont fight me . look , hes scared .
one , two , three .
still wont fight hes got the heart of a lion .
just needs some time .
whyd you take off your helmet you going to cry .
my father died too , but you dont see me crying .
melot . thats right , run .
find another trapdoor to hide under , coward .
tristan .
tristan tristan . we found something .
come on , this way . quick , come on .
you are gonna love it . youll love it .
yeah , i i found this trapdoor .
who found a trapdoor .
all right , simon . well , you tell us how you found it .
look at that .
where does this lead .
youll see .
well , i like that vase .
think ill have that .
we always knew the castle was built on roman foundations .
but we didnt think anything was left .
must be a burial crypt or something .
here we are . bottom of the keep .
who else knows about this .
nobody . good .
these savages have rebuilt the castle in cornwall .
only now its made of stone .
for cornwalls next tribute , i want slaves young ones .
their future .
if marke resists , have morholt crush him .
my king . morholt .
i have led your armies to victories far and near .
ive made you rich and powerful .
yes , you have . you have been most loyal .
when i return from cornwall , i was hoping .
what would please you .
a wife .
its dark in an hour .
what do you think is really out there .
britannia .
the old roman lands .
a world full of evil and grief .
i want to see it .
do you know what the future looks like , bragnae .
i see the life you were meant for .
your father will speak with you .
am i just a chattel to be traded at your pleasure .
do i have no say in my own life .
you have a duty to your king .
you are my father .
then obey me , daughter .
your father has given you the news .
and do you welcome it i accept it .
you know , were more alike than you might guess .
how so .
i , too , dabble in elixirs .
poison . its from the livers of puffer fish .
just a taste paralyzes all the senses .
so if the blade doesnt kill .
rendered safe by thistle and bark .
and do you know the antidote for this .
yohimbine .
makes a hard man even harder .
the only cure: wild abandon .
till our wedding day .
release them .
hey . around . around .
off me .
go find tristan . leave her .
take him there . get a rope .
anyone foolish enough to interfere in any way .
shall suffer the same fate . no .
please dont . dont . take me . no no .
widseth .
if there are any more attacks , we shall put our guests .
to death and raze this entire land .
take the horses .
when would you strike at once .
throw everything we have at them . theyre hoping youll do that .
on horse they outnumber us 2to1 . youll lead the men straight to their deaths .
so we do nothing donnchadh would like that even more .
me to lose face in front of the other tribes .
no . we must act .
it must be decisive .
but we cannot act alone .
so have the good men of york come to fight with us .
hmm or the saxons of wessex .
my men dont want to follow a pict into battle .
let alone one leading a pack of angles and celts .
then why are you here .
i thought tristan should let me command his men .
i make it my habit to follow no one . except marke .
marke delivered me from that palace when i was a boy . you ran .
so you can understand when i think ofkings , i think ofhim .
and when i think of cowards theyre one day from their boats on the roman road .
now , who will ride out with tristan to fight them .
what is your plan , tristan .
i need our two fastest runners .
there they go after them .
hold off .
halt .
go around .
morholt theyre back .
theyve got a head .
its a trap .
kill the slaves .
simon .
were gonna get you home .
i dont want to die .
i cant feel my legs or my hands .
poison .
a second boat .
he shall have a kings service .
farewell , tristan of aragon .
death to the irish .
when the irish came to cornwall .
and my father surrendered .
you spared a dozen out of a hundred .
i am even less kind .
the leader and three will take this message home .
as for the rest .
victory .
and tristan .
simon too .
did i love him like a son .
or did i misuse him for my own purposes he knew .
he knew .
where are we going away .
are you afflicted , child speak to me .
your father will find us and have my head .
you are my charge . please .
i am no ones charge .
you are .
and you will be morholts lady .
and live a loveless life like my mom .
whats that .
where .
isolde , wait . dont .
isolde , dont .
isolde its a man .
dead .
alive bragnae , help me .
help me .
isolde . quickly .
start a fire .
oh . quickly .
his heart falters .
what are you doing he needs heat . now .
get your clothes off , quickly .
hurry .
quickly smell that smell the poison .
when he warms , well need thistle and bark .
ive not been naked with a man for 15 years .
hello .
youve been sleeping a long time .
youre in ireland . did you know that .
shh .
its all right .
youre safe here . no one knows .
dont be scared . just sleep .
sleep .
oh .
no its all right . you dont need that .
i forgot to tell him about you .
ill wait outside with the other beasts .
you said no one else knew . sorry .
shes my maid , sworn to silence .
um , lie down , please .
please .
its good youre remembering things . this might sting .
do you remember anything else .
the boat i found you in .
how you got this .
too many questions . there . keep that dry .
here are clothes , bread .
you have water and fire .
the oceans outside if you wish a bath .
you wont know where youre going , so please dont try to leave .
just trust me .
why are you doing this .
ill be back .
this is a dangerous game youre playing .
hes english , isolde . and weve got him prisoner .
under no circumstances tell him your name , you hear me .
i thought you wished to escape this place .
did you hear me .
youll do no such thing . hell need more food tomorrow .
hes not of your concern .
youve been away . oh , you noticed .
yes , i have a bit . where .
bragnae and i were spying the convent at brittas .
seeking sanctuary some women need it .
youll find no refuge in the new religion .
your place is here , with morholt .
any word of my betrothed .
overdue .
but comforted , no doubt , that you yearn for him .
whats your name .
oh , i think its better we dont bother with names .
how can i thank you if i dont have your name .
you just did .
if you insist , my name is bragnae .
im a ladyinwaiting at the court . my parents are dead .
my mother , shes the source of the kindness you find so puzzling .
my father would have left you where you fell .
im tristan of aragon .
well , tristan of aragon .
id guess about you too , but i think ive already seen everything .
sir , i hope you appreciate the risks .
we are taking and will honor us by leaving as soon as you are able .
she likes me .
shes right though . you do risk .
here . and what of your parents .
they also died when i was a child .
of what .
a different type of irish kindness .
im sorry .
tomorrow then .
tomorrow .
there she who bore you brought you forth .
set me as a seal upon your heart .
as a seal upon your arm .
for love is as strong as death . .
ridiculous .
i happen to believe what that says .
dont you think theres more to life .
than what something more than duty and death .
why be capable of feelings if were not to have them .
why long for things if theyre not meant to be ours .
oh , dont listen to me .
youre so sure of things .
your certainty , itsits like armor . i wish i had that .
why would you need it the joy of being a lady .
wanting something i cant have .
a life of my own .
time you must leave now .
ill follow you later .
you need a rest .
in case your betrothed would want to see you .
youre promised .
yes .
whats he like .
dark , tall , nearly twice your size .
an absolute gentleman .
i thought .
earlier when you spoke of wanting something you cant have .
i didnt know what i was talking about .
outside , just past that bluff , there is a boat .
thats how you should go when you leave .
you should go soon .
how do you feel .
its lord bodkin .
tristan they found your boat .
at this very moment , the king himself is scouring the coasts .
hell find you . he finds everyone . the tide is coming . you must go .
come with me .
come with me . i cant .
why not please .
tristan , we both know this cant be . weve known it from the start .
that doesnt mean it isnt true . it is .
it just cannot be .
i want to know that youre alive somewhere and thinking of me from time to time .
i want to know that theres more to this life , and i cant know that if they kill you .
a cornish warrior may be ashore .
beware . we seek him as i speak .
hopefully , its just his rotted corpse well find .
for he has slain your betrothed .
morholt is dead , fallen in battle .
isolde .
bragnae , catch and comfort her .
we should , uh we should assault the british straightaway .
crush them with maximum force .
maximum force .
the one butchered by markes tribes would that be the force you speak of .
well not confront them again until our numbers are refreshed .
and until then .
well have cunning divide them .
of what nature .
a prize , perhaps .
whats this about a tournament .
donnchadh .
hes offered his daughter and the lands of lionath .
as dowry to whichever english tribe wins .
its a clever way of setting us against each other .
well , the other barons will see through that .
as baron of wessex .
its my duty to fight in this tournament for my people .
for yourself , you mean . and what of the support you promised tristan .
tristans dead .
my people have suffered enough .
they see the wealth of lionath on offer . that seems more real than any alliance .
my mind is set . and ours as well .
so be it .
youre weary . let me rally our friends . ill lead them against donn .
melot , melot , melot , melot , melot .
youre my blood .
and youre a noble presence , but .
hes back hes alive .
tristan we thought you werent alive .
hes back lord marke , its tristan .
it cant be .
i saw you dead .
i am delivered .
please , tristan , tell us more .
tristan , there must be a story .
a toast to tristan .
back from the dead . yeah , back from the dead .
tristan , the irish king offers his daughter in tournament and divides all our tribes .
whether for the power or the wealth , half the barons .
are sending champions to fight at dunluce . tristan .
god knows what happened to him .
my face in thine eyes .
thine in mine appears .
and true plain hearts do in the faces rest .
whatever dies was not mixed equally .
if our two loves be one .
or thou and i love so alike .
that none can slacken , none can die . .
what its the only way to keep the alliance alive .
i fail to see how fighting with our partners keeps us allies .
well , theyre all going to the tournament anyway .
by announcing youll share the dowry with every baron who remains loyal .
while in turn offering support to whomever prevails .
the others will be compelled to follow you when you win it . if we win .
if we lose , we could end up following wictred .
id need an infallible champion .
me .
youre not yet healed .
well , this trip will be my tonic . ill be ready .
you know i will .
whats the source of this fervor .
let me go and win you a wife .
she can make peace without spilling one drop of blood .
and maybe heal the wound from which you still ache .
truce .
you have safe passage .
youll all go over there .
how do i look how do you look .
wheres this princess whats her name , isolde .
i want to see what she looks like .
there . almost done .
no , not quite .
if im a present , i should be fully wrapped .
name lebourne of bracht .
i dont believe you .
name .
name .
ah , see how the bees come to the honey .
name tristan of aragon .
so he lives . for the moment .
wictred of glastonbury .
i fight with no champion in my stead .
note that .
why wictred .
because the barons will never unite behind him .
you think shes got the pox .
since the dawn of time .
the knight has gathered at tournaments .
for only a true heart can prevail in battle .
warriors , begin .
hes got him now .
make it look real . what .
i yield .
real enough , i hope .
water you did great .
yeah look .
no hey you cant do that .
allow it .
hunwalt yields to tristan of aragon .
antwon of wessex will fight kingsid .
hey its too easy for you , eh .
good , tristan good so much for a fair draw .
lord wictred of glastonbury be sure . choose the right time .
wear him down first , huh tristan of aragon will fight singbard .
hallach yields to the lord wictred .
yeah .
singbard yields to tristan of aragon .
kingsid yields to antwon of wessex .
lord wictred of glastonbury will fight fohall .
fohall yields .
to lord wictred .
anwalt yields to tristan of aragon .
lord wictred of glastonbury will fight morlock .
mace . tristan of aragon .
from the house of cornwall , will fight hunwalt .
morlock yields to lord wictred .
well done , tristan . you have this . this is yours .
you have one more fight . take deep breaths .
one more and youre done . come on .
wictred , lord of glastonbury .
tristan , champion of marke of cornwall .
tristan tristan .
go on .
go , tristan .
yield .
yeah .
you did it .
an impressive victory .
of course , the man who defeats morholt might be expected to triumph here .
on behalf of cornwall .
i offer your daughter a place on our throne .
the throne of england , united behind one leader .
perhaps it is just that he who took a husband provides one .
im yours .
tristan of aragon .
has won you on behalf of lord marke of cornwall .
come on . lets go .
come , isolde . come .
weve done it , huh .
let them take her across the sea .
after the wedding , ill disavow isolde .
this alliance will crumble .
the princess wants to speak to you .
you risked your life to give me to another man .
you said your name was bragnae .
why did you do that .
god , what have i done .
youll stop this then . say something .
i cant . i won you in my kings name .
but im yours . you touched me , and i you . it doesnt matter .
its the only thing that matters , tristan . leave with me . ill go anywhere .
your marriage will end a hundred years of bloodshed . my marriage to another man .
isolde . we will live with this .
we must .
dont do this to me .
tristan , weve made shore .
what if shes a hag or she simply wont have me .
she will , brother . youre the prize .
a rose look at her .
my lord .
isolde . welcome .
i couldnt be happier .
if things were different .
if we lived in a place without duty , would you be with me .
that place does not exist .
ill pretend its you .
youre trembling .
youre far from home . im a stranger still . that i understand .
but you mustnt fear me . hmm .
my only wish is to make you happy .
as a wife . as a woman .
and hopefully , one day .
the fact that im not whole .
will not offend you .
thats pretty . did you make it .
it was a present .
tristan . might i stay here a while .
of course .
a little bit sour , but taste it .
ive never seen him like this before .
perhaps someone his own age should speak with him .
perhaps .
marke and edyth say youre distant .
theyre worried about you . so am i . i can tell .
laughing at the market , holding hands .
a caress on the neck when he pours your wine .
hes my husband . i remember whose kingdom im in and why . yes , well . i must confess .
i thought you might have the tiniest of difficulties performing your duties .
am i not permitted a single moment without mourning .
im living with this , tristan , as you said we must .
i live in torture , thinking of these moments .
every look he gives you , i get sicker and sicker .
theres a burning in me . i feel on fire , and theres guilt , and i cant get rid of either .
does it make you happy to know that .
the roman bridge .
i can get to it without being seen .
and i would go there any time to be with you .
welcome , barons of anglia , rothgar and orick .
wessex , kaye and wictred .
as you will be king and his daughter queen .
does that mean donnchadh will be coming to the coronation .
it does , on the next full moon . all will attend .
a lot can happen in a month .
and given the instabilities of our new land .
i shall be naming a second .
my sister has raised one capable of guiding you , should the need arise .
hes a man of passion , fierce in battle .
who has learned to tame his heart with his head .
i give you tristan of aragon .
for the first time since the romans .
this country stands united .
i cant be your second . melot must be . hes blood .
besides , i wish tojourney north .
you no longer sleep at dor , and now you dont want to be my second .
and you find no comfort in your home , these stone walls that you helped build .
i find these walls a prison . why .
everything i wanted seems meaningless .
ever since you were a boy .
youve sacrificed everything for me , all for one dream .
now youve reached that dream .
its natural that youll feel some loss .
it doesnt matter if you want to be second . you are .
i will only be king if you are my second .
id put it more gently if i could . then i am your second .
perhaps its time you took a wife . no .
you cant live alone forever . i can .
i was trying to explain to tristan the importance oflove .
seems he might live without it . why .
there are other things to live for duty , honor .
they are not life , tristan . they are the shells of life .
and empty ones if in the end .
all they hold are days and days without love .
love is made by god .
ignore it and you suffer as you cannot imagine .
then i will no longer live without it .
good . very good .
come . well be late . late .
the warriors ride out on the full moon .
its an old ritual . i shall miss you tonight .
how many did you love before me .
none .
and after me .
lord marke are you all right .
nothing hurt but my pride .
tristan , i need to speak with you . yeah .
we havent even had a coronation yet , and marke and wictred are already at odds .
now , he breaks tradition and scares all the barons by naming you his second .
i tried to convince him youd be better .
yes , well , peace can be just as treacherous as war .
and i fear that marke doesnt re .
listen to me .
our attention must be on cornwall , now more than ever . melot .
im sorry he didnt choose you . i am .
can i speak to you .
uncle , you dont seem to understand what you have done here .
im sick of your moaning why cant .
what do you think became of them .
they were lives , just lived .
i find myself imagining things in this place .
i decorate it books , a harp there .
a child .
would it be his or mine .
id have no way to tell , would i .
hes a kind man , tristan . i cannot hate him .
yesterday at the market , i saw a couple holding hands .
and i realized well never do that .
never anything like it .
no picnics or unguarded smiles .
no rings .
just stolen moments that leave too quickly .
this ones pretty . they look the same to me .
i like this one . tristan , where have you been hiding .
now that youre here , are we going to be honored with your presence tonight .
whwhere is the .
about time .
wheres isolde i dont know for sure .
she was having a walk in the garden before and .
im afraid i grew tired , so i returned .
um , its my fault .
want to get caught , the both of you .
hes lookin for you right now .
not through the castle . hell see you .
i told you this was going to happen .
theres another door here , forgotten .
this comes up in the bottom chamber of the keep .
i hate this . hurry .
go on .
im tired of this . tired of lying for you .
sick of it . then dont .
there was a servants child . quite ill , but doing better now .
i didnt ask you where you were .
your hearts beating so fast .
is it .
is there anything i can do to make you happy .
i want to make you happy .
im fine .
shes in love with tristan . theyre intimates .
if i expose them , itll break markes heart and his hold on the other barons .
with markes champion in chains , ill take castle dor .
you can land your armies unopposed . therell be no one defending the inland waters .
and your price .
i want markes throne .
in a few years , when his reign falls apart .
well go over and pick up the pieces .
may i speak with you .
is it possible , do you think , a man blinded by love .
is it possible that man might not see treachery right in front of him .
i found this hidden among isoldes things .
do you think she has a lover .
has she said anything to you .
perhaps you could follow her . i , uh .
l i cant ask anyone else .
i know , i i know what you think . im acting like a child , but .
normally i can read faces .
with hers , i feel i i cant be objective .
shes so delicate . i just look at it and i .
you really love her .
oh , i do . terribly .
i didnt know how empty i was .
she sustains me . she thrills me .
and when i see this ring , its a ring of thorns .
the ring is nothing . shes loyal to you .
im sure of it .
if you say so .
i count nine .
if they move in , have your squires fly a black flag .
you bring an entourage .
i cant go sailing all alone in my position , lord marke .
dont worry . theyll stay offshore .
daughter , i have missed you .
my nephew , melot , governor of cornwall .
and tristan , slayer of my best general .
winner of isolde . defender of the alliance .
youre a fortunate man . indeed .
seems i worried for nothing .
may i dance with the queen .
or is tristan to have the next one no .
thats right . youve never danced with isolde before .
a new song for tristan .
slow .
why did you burn it .
you know .
meet me there now or ill die .
i could still tutor you a thing or two .
accuse him now . no , no , no , no .
well have more than accusations .
is something the matter im im just feeling a little weary , thats all .
might just go and have a lie down .
friends , friends , hear me .
weve forgotten the full moon . isnt it time to ride out .
no , no , no , no . this night calls for an exception .
oh , but the coronation should uphold tradition .
surely , do we neglect it already .
we honor it with half a night .
ride out .
wheres tristan .
i miss ireland .
isolde , this must end .
thats like asking me to stop breathing . it cannot be .
hey , hey , hey , hey . over here . through here .
please dont leave me .
isolde . tristan , what are you .
i see how it is in cornwall .
my money is good enough . my alliance is good enough .
but my daughter you pass among your lieutenants like a whore .
its not like i see no relation to me here .
there is no peace with this king .
i pledge no allegiance to shame . i wont fight for this .
seize them .
behold your hero , uncle .
ill have my own heroes now .
theyre ashore .
prove your worth .
if a man cant rule his woman .
how can he govern an entire kingdom he cant .
yeah . we should sue for peace .
its all been coming apart . you can feel it .
youre right . theres very little time .
fortunately , donnchadh has no quarrel with anyone here .
hes asked me to give you a message .
whats this .
its compensation for the men youll lose .
attacking castle dor with donnchadh tomorrow .
lets be honest . our people need a stronger chief .
who might that be , wictred melot .
for too long , the ablest among us has been denied his rightful place .
i pledge him my allegiance and offer my services as his second .
i like this plan .
i came to apologize . ive been selfish .
arrogantly thinking that perhaps id given enough .
over these past nine years to merit , if not your love , then at least your respect .
a home .
a kingdom , your very life .
why was it not enough .
tell me .
tell me .
you dont know what you have done .
everything is destroyed everything .
all because you did not have enough .
shes loyal to you . i am sure of it . .
you bloodsucker . what i could have been .
had i not stretched out this hand to save your wretched life .
how i curse that day . how i curse it .
well , insult me with your defense .
then i will contemplate your punishment .
donnchadh marches on us as we speak .
shes young , and they were wrong .
but king or no king , i will not let you harm her .
how long .
since you thought he was dead .
i found him , wounded , on a beach in ireland .
i hid him from my father .
and i told him my name was bragnae .
so when he came to the tournament at dunluce to win donnchadhs daughter .
he didnt realize it was me .
all this time , my heart has been his .
and im sorry .
he tried harder .
than you can possibly imagine , because he loves you .
i will coax them out and make sure donnchadh knows this .
of course . of course .
you know , as things move forward .
i must confess i suspected the both of them for some time .
tristan and isolde you know what i could never work out .
how it was conducted . how she got in and out of dor unseen .
the tunnel . what .
the roman tunnel .
show me .
what is this .
the will of the king .
farewell .
you two . run up . get up in the keep .
i told him about ireland .
hes given us our freedom .
why does loving you feel so wrong .
get in .
tristan , if we do this .
for all time , theyd say it was our love brought down a kingdom .
remember us .
tristan , no tristan stop stop .
tristan enough .
isolde . tristan .

without sharp north , without declining west .
whatever dies was not mixed equally .
and thou and i love so alike that none can slacken .

and very young .
and i loved him so fiercely .
then you said yes , right .
no . i wanted to say yes , but i said no .
i wasnt ready , .
neither was he .
so we took our time .
looked forward to it .
didnt want to run into something with nothing to count on but love .
a man has to be understanding .
and put his wife before himself .
can you do that , peter .
yeah . i think i can .
then you have my blessing .
i hope youve considered a proper proposal .
your uncle had it all planned .

we were very good swimmers .
it was a beautiful day , .
and he said: lets swim to the island .
and at the island , .
we found a perfect spot by an old tree , .
and we lay down and looked up at the sky .
and then he said , close your eyes , may .
and i did . and then he said , open them .
and i did .
and he was holding this ring .
dazzling , in front of me .
i thought it was the sun .

and i have this ring .
ah . all� .
oh , so you want to pop the question tonight , hein .
yes , and i want to do something very special .
i love it .
romance .
i am french .
when i signal you , if youd bring some champagne with the ring .
inside bottom of her glass .
perfect . magnifique .
also i thought , at the same time .
could the musicians .
play this song .
their favorite .
and take good care of the ring .
they are an army unlike any other .
crusading across the stars toward a place called underverse .
their promised land . a constellation of dark new worlds .
necromongers theyre called .
and if they cannot convert you , they will kill you .
leading them , the lord marshal .
he alone has made a pilgrimage to the gates of the underverse .
and returned a different being .
stronger . stranger . half alive and half .
something else .
if we are to survive , a new balance must be found .
in normal times , evil would be fought by good .
but in times like these .
well , it should be fought by another kind of evil .
lining him up for you .
portside shot coming up .
steady . here we go .
take it take a shot .
shit .
toombs , were running out of rope shut up i got it again .
now .
toombs .
riddick .
i dont know , toombs . looks kind of tight .
not where im sitting . this is the biggest payday ever .
so throw on a fresh pair of panties . lets get this right .
three meters clearance portside . one and a half meters starboard .
we got a chokepoint coming up .
what the shit was that .
tags , you got eyes on riddick .
tags .
jesus .
he just ghosted two guys , and i never even saw him .
what do you think maybe we ought to just .
i think youre my new gunner . grab a gat .
stay on top of him this time .
you made three mistakes .
first , you took the job .
second , you came light .
a fourman crew for me fucking insulting .
but the worst mistake you made .
thats right . empty gun rack .
whats the bounty on my head 1 mil .
1.5 .
what slam pays 1.5 for a convict .
private party .
guy easy anonymous . thats what the sheet said .
what planet .
helion prime .
whoa . where you going last question .
and you better get this one right , merc .
whose ship is this .
mine wrong answer .
knew theyd come for me . took them five years , but i knew .
you dont expect these mercs to have any honour , any code .
but this new bounty from a holy man .
a guy whose neck i saved .
well , lesson learned . no such word as friend .
can only end bad when you let someone get too close .
bad for them .
so now its back to civilisation .
all the brightness , and everything i hate .
just wanted to be left alone .
helion prime is on alert condition four .
all unrecognised craft will be escorted to the ground .
for security inspections .
unrecognised craft , follow me .
to spaceport 6 for security inspections .
do you hear me follow me to spaceport 6 now .
follow this .
did you know all your doors were locked .
five years ago , i took two people off that planet .
a kid , jack , who everyone else thought was a boy .
and a holy man searching for new mecca .
i told one man where i might go .
i showed trust to one man .
did i make a mistake , lmam .
there is no simple answer .
whatever was said was meant to give us a chance .
a fighting chance .
were it not for the threat of invasion .
i never would have betrayed you . i give you my word , riddick .
riddick .
and a daughter .
no . whose name would be .
if you have issue with me , you let it be with me .
you need not know their names .
ziza . my name is ziza .
ziza .
cute kid .
did you really kill monsters .
the ones that were gonna hurt my father .
such are our bedtime stories .
go , ziza . go on .
it is said the comet always precedes them .
these worldenders .
the coalsack planets are gone . eight million settlers missing .
the entire aquilan system is gone , too .
my god , how do i save my family .
have you heard anything ive said .
you said its all circling the drain . the whole universe .
right thats right .
had to end sometime .
the one you want is now here .
and whose throat is this .
if you cut my throat .
ill not be able to rescind the offer that brought you here .
nor tell you why its so vital that you did come .
the blade comes off when the bounty comes off .
this is aereon . an envoy from the elemental race .
she means you no harm .
there are very few of us .
who have met a necromonger and lived to speak of it .
so when i choose to speak of it , you should choose to listen .
necromonger .
it is the name that will convert or kill .
every last human life .
unless furyan warriors are found .
maybe you should pretend like youre talking to .
someone educated in the penal system .
in fact , dont pretend .
there is a story , riddick , of young male furyans .
strangled at birth . strangled with their own cords .
when aereon told this story to the helion leaders .
i told her of you .
what do you know of your early years .
do you remember your homeworld where it was .
have you met any others others like yourself .
sister , they dont know what to do with just one of me .
spoken like a true furyan .
open up in there open up stand back .
they are searching houses .
they look for a man who came here today .
they think he might be a spy . a spy .
did someone see him come here today did they .
lajjun , stop .
i will send them away . but wait one minute , please .
will you wait one minute to save worlds .
not my fight .
so you will leave us to our fate .
just like you did her . break it down .
get in .
come , let us try to send them away .
just let me have her come on .
leave us alone .
there is no one here .
you dont understand . he can help us .
youre not afraid of the dark , are you .
the light hurts my eyes .
where is he he went to this side .
where is he .
in here .
you mentioned her .
she went looking for you .
people died . she went to prison . i am not sure where .
it was a world so hot , you couldnt set foot on the surface .
crematoria .
young jack . she thought of you as her older brother .
she worshipped you . you were supposed to watch her .
she never forgave you for leaving .
just when she needed you most . she needed to stay away from me .
you all do .
are you gonna stop the new monsters now .
furyans . defiant to the end .
no , no . we go to the shelter .
we take only ourselves .
turn back go to the other shelter .
they wont let us in get back .
stay close .
we must cross the river .
flight leaders , all squads off the ground now .
we have heavy inbound .
theyre coming back .
the next shelter . this way .
ill see if its safe .
stay back . come , ziza .
dont they have real guns .
take aim and fire .
now theyre going down .
lajjun and ziza .
when its over .
let me go . i must go to my family . when its over .
lets get your family .
in here .
get in .
imam . dont follow me .
there will be an afterlife for me .
will there be for you .
lets go replenish the ranks .
never fails to inspire , does it each time a dynasty falls .
remember your place , dame vaako .
my place is at your side , dear husband .
from here till underverse come .
in this verse , humans have been fractured .
divided by all their many races , creeds , and mistaken faiths .
our purpose is to correct that mistake .
because there is another verse .
another universe that he has found .
where anyone can begin anew .
where you can live free of pain .
a perfect new place called underverse .
look around you . every necromonger in this hall .
every one of the legion vast .
that just swept aside your defences in one night .
was once like you .
fought as feebly as you .
because every necromonger that lives today is a convert .
therell be no conversions .
we all began as something else .
it was hard for me to accept , too , when i first heard these words .
but i changed .
i let them take away my pain .
you betrayed your faith . and i changed .
just as you will change .
when you realise that the underverse will be reached .
only by those who have embraced the necromonger faith .
for those of you who will right now .
drop to your knees and ask to be purified .
we will not renounce our faith no one here will do what you ask .
it is unthinkable .
this is a world of many peoples , many religions .
and we simply cannot and will not be converted .
then ill take your soul .
join him .
or join me .
this is your one chance .
take the lord marshals offer and bow .
i bow to no man .
hes not a man .
hes the holy halfdead who has seen the underverse .
and returned with powers you cant imagine .
look , im not with everyone here .
but i will take a piece of him .
a piece you will have .
stop him .
irgun . one of my best .
if you say so .
what do you think of this blade .
i think its a halfgram heavy on the back end .
in our faith , you keep what you kill .
take him back to my ship for mind regression .
perhaps the breeder would do it .
if somebody just asked him .
it is a rare offer .
a visit inside necropolis .
its been a long time since i smelled beautiful .
let me show you the way .
beautiful eyes . come .
the last six lord marshals have called this home .
magnificent , isnt it .
i might have gone a different way . true of us all .
converts receiving the mark of the necromonger .
they learn how one pain can lessen another .
there now .
that is just perfect .
the more you resist them .
the greater the damage will be .
a new one .
youve brought us a new one .
interesting breeder .
making entry .
this wont take long .
weve entered his neocortex .
the riddick regress .
scanning fresh memories .
thoughts of someone called jack .
jack .
she went to prison .
now we find thoughts of an elemental .
the one race that would slow the spread of necromongers .
furyans .
where does he come from .
who are his people these are the things i need to know .
we find energy .
we find furyan energy .
hes furyan .
a furyan survivor kill the furyan .
kill the riddick .
kill riddick .
find him . whatever it takes . find him .
let me guess . a fiveman crew this time .
couple of things you could have done better .
first , trash the locater beacon inside my ship , the one you jacked .
and second , and this is really the more important part .
you should have wasted me when you had the chance .
any questions yeah .
what took you so long .
decoy launched .
in and out . unsuspected and undetected .
damn , i love a good smashandgrab .
bountys as good as ours . preparing to engage ion drive .
so where do we drop your merckilling ass .
whos gonna pay the most for you now butcher bay .
butcher bay .
ten minutes every other day on the dogrun .
protein waffles arent bad .
how about ursa luna nice little doublemax prison .
they keep a cell open for me , just in case i drop in .
you know the problem with these joints now .
health clubs for waffleeating pussies .
maybe we should think about upping our game here a little bit .
think about someplace truly diabolical .
what the hell is he thinking now .
hes thinking a triplemax prison . a nodaylight slam .
only three of them left in this system .
two of them out of range .
for a shitty little undercutter like this one with no legs .
leaving just one .
crematoria .
that is what you had in mind , right , toombs .
how does he know where were going , and we dont .
dope it out . i hate this run .
just do it .
dont know about this new crew of yours .
they seem a bit skittish .
probably shouldnt tell them what happened to the last crew .
you know , you were supposed to be some slickshit killer .
now look at you . all backofthebus and shit .
i say we attack helion two next . take it straight into their teeth .
itll cost you 20,000 heads , 5 warrior ships .
nothing more , i swear it . while i do prize brute force .
this approach is , perhaps , more artful .
start at the end . go straight to helion five .
the last planet in the system .
we approach from the night side .
remove these cannon first .
then attack the larger placements at speed .
well catch them on their rear flank .
and in 10 days time .
the rest of those worlds will tumble before us .
you see , as with most .
their blind spot is right behind them .
ive located an ion trail which leads offworld .
then you should be offworld , vaako .
ive deployed a tracker team . one of the best .
wherever riddick has gone .
you lens him out and cleanse him . you .
you want me to take a frigate for one breeder .
dont question it , vaako .
take it on faith .
hes always been unsettled around you .
the lord marshal . unsteady .
perhaps because he knows hes half the warrior you are .
some say hes too artistic for the job .
i wouldnt be surprised if someone promoted him soon .
to full dead .
take care what you say . should i say it softly .
so it sounds more like conspiracy .
why is it that when anyone breathes about the demise .
of him on the throne everyone assumes a conspiracy .
why isnt that just prudent planning .
when he is ready , he will name a successor .
who .
toal scales .
the purifier .
none of them .
with the strength , the dignity .
of lord vaako .
you can keep what you kill .
that is the necromonger way .
mercenaries . elementals . necromongers .
how unexpected .
an elemental . here .
one of the captives .
and why , after 30 years , should it be you .
he doesnt regard her as a captive , though .
elementals . they talk of neutrality , but theyre all witches and spies .
why else would they come and go like the wind .
but where has he gone where is the furyan hiding now .
you be the good warrior . go after this riddick .
ill find out why the lord marshal is so threatened by him .
destination reached . unlocking manual controls .
all right , i make 700 degrees on the day side .
300 below on the night side .
lets not get caught in the sun .
if i owned this place and hell , id rent this place out .
and live in hell .
slue angle: good . stand by .
and plotted course .
good . hit it .
angle of approach: not good .
look , ma , no hands .
party poppers .
i think i shit myself .
skittish , toombs . very skittish .
comfy .
when the rides over , your goggles are mine .
fourway split .
29.4 kilometres .
so this is riddick .
what in the bowels of christ are you talking about 700,000 .
dont take this one , boss .
see , anatoli here has a nose for trouble .
and this one , this riddick guy big , big trouble .
so 700,000 is good money .
id take the money , toombs .
these are dangerous days , if you believe the talk .
talk about dead planets .
about some ghost army .
about them .
them .
ill run the numbers again . it takes a couple of days probably .
so you can stay as my guest .
at least here we are all safe . yes .
yes , boss .
ill give it a day .
one .
there are inmates , and there are convicts .
a convict has a certain code .
and he knows to show a certain respect .
an inmate , on the other hand .
pulls the pin on his fellow man .
does the guards work for them . brings shame .
to the game .
so which are you gonna be .
im just passing through .
welcome to crematoria .
how do i get eyes like that you got to kill a few people .
did that . did a lot of that .
and then you got to get sent to a slam .
where youre told you wont see daylight again .
there wasnt a doctor who could shine my eyes .
not even for 20 menthol kools . was anything you said true .
what are you gonna do go for the sweet spot .
remember who youre talking to , jack .
jacks dead .
she was weak .
she couldnt cut it .
the names kyra now .
and im a new animal .
im so glad i could steal you away for a moment .
doesnt it strike you odd .
here we have the current lord marshal .
destroying entire societies .
and yet he cant bring himself to kill one stranded elemental .
why is that .
you dont pray to our god . you pray to no god , i hear .
elementals , we calculate .
dont we all .
but now lets have first things first .
what of riddick .
in truth , i dont know where he went .
in truth , im more interested in where he came from .
watch your step .
ive always wondered , does an air elemental fly .
now do me a favour .
calculate the odds of you getting off this planet alive .
and now cut them in half .
no , we cant fly . but we glide very well .
save your threats , necromonger .
i would have told you about riddick for the asking .
it concerns a foretelling .
a prediction now more than 30 years old .
a young warrior once consulted a seer of sorts .
and was told that he would die at the hands of a furyan .
so he waged a private war on the planet furya .
killing all he could find .
this was before he became lord marshal , of course .
that massacre should have ended the matter .
but now it seems one furyan had a knack .
for escape .
feeding time .
move lets go come on .
hurry .
to the cages .
a herd a goddamn herd is that all we are to you .
let me in .
wait .
its an animal thing .
check her for me . shes always got a blade somewhere .
i dont think she likes being touched .
id take my wounded and go while you still can .
is there a name for this private little world of yours .
what happens there when we dont just run away .
youll kill us with a soup cup .
tea , actually .
ill kill you with my tea cup .
you know the rule .
they arent dead if theyre still on the books .
death by tea cup .
damn . why didnt i think of that .
i didnt come here to play whos the better killer .
but its my favourite game . havent you heard .
i heard you came looking for me .
is that all then you missed the good part .
hooked up with some mercs out of lupus five .
said theyd take me on , teach me the trade , give me a good cut .
they slaved me out , riddick .
do you know what that could do to you when youre that age .
when youre 12 years old i told you to stay in new mecca .
did you not listen .
i had mercs on my neck . ill always have mercs on my neck .
i spent five years on a frozen heap just to keep them away from you .
and you go and sign up with the same fake badges .
that wanted to cut you up and use you for bait .
what are you pitching , riddick .
that you cutting out was a good thing .
that you had my ass covered from halfway across the universe .
you signed with mercs .
there was nobody else around .
lets pop the cork . get some fresh air .
so they do go topside .
to swap out air .
interesting .
who the hell are you .
when it happens , itll happen fast .
stay on my leg when i cut fence , or die here .
nobody outs this place . nobody .
he aint nobody .
seven hundred degrees .
jesus .
thats some sunrise .
no , thats not why im here at all .
good news first .
talked things over with my amigos here .
well cut you in for 775,000 .
all right . whats the bad news .
they close the local whorehouse .
no . the bad news is worse than that . much worse .
our pilot , he saw this .
it crossed a shipping lane .
any idea what this might be .
never saw nothing like it .
this ship charts back to helion prime .
you know , anatolis got a nose for trouble .
and he thinks trouble follows you here .
look , we dusted our tracks and got the hell out of there .
there is no way we didnt lose them .
this is my prisoner .
mine . nobody elses .
and i want my money now .
you stole a prisoner from them .
riddick , no .
shouldve taken the money , toombs .
mercs .
some guards here , but this cant be all of them .
check their slots in the back . and be careful .
dont bother . guards aint there .
they figured out the necros are coming for me .
plan was to clean the bank , ghost the mercs .
break wide through the tunnel .
then somebody got a lucky shot off with this rocket launcher here .
and took out the sled .
guards took off on foot .
but rigged the door so no one could follow .
theyll take the one ship in the hangar .
and leave everyone else here to die .
how come you know all this shit .
you werent even here .
cause it was my plan .
its moving in the right direction . we could make it .
stay behind the night .
ahead of the sun .
theres gonna be one speed .
mine .
if you cant keep up , dont step up . youll just die .
i shouldve taken the money .
up there .
take a look . because anatoli says so .
because his nose says so .
go come on , go .
climb here .
climb go .
theyre heading for the volcano fields .
going for our ship .
no chance do they get to the hangar first . no chance .
next one next hole well catch them there .
no more running for you .
where did the big guy go .
close it .
what was that you dont care if you live or die .
if i kill them first , not really .
maybe i do .
keep moving .
kyra .
kyra what .
get that ass moving .
remember what i said about not caring if i lived or died .
you knew i was kidding , right .
one speed .
your rope .
its too late . were never gonna make it .
your rope give me your rope .
and your water . all of it .
stay in the shadow of the mountain .
dont wait for me . run .
where the hell is that hangar .
there it is .
listen .
let me guess . necros .
one commander .
five captains . and a whole lot of necro firepower .
shit i hate not being the bad guys .
i figure we got three minutes .
before the sun hits us again , burns out this whole valley .
we gonna do this or not .
just wait .
remember that favourite game of yours .
whos the better killer .
lets play .
on the right .
hand .
i was supposed to deliver a message to you .
if vaako failed to kill you .
a message from the lord marshal himself .
he tells you to stay away from helion .
stay away from him .
and in return , youll be hunted no more .
but vaako will most likely report you as dead .
so this is your chance .
your chance to do what no man has ever done .
the girl .
where will they take her .
to the lord marshal , of course .
ive done unbelievable things .
in the name of a faith that was never my own .
and hell do to her what he did to me .
the necromonger in me warns you not to go back .
but the furyan in me .
hopes you wont listen .
we all began as something else .
i have lost a purifier .
but i have gained a first among commanders .
it is overdue , isnt it .
that we acknowledge your many accomplishments .
your steady faith .
your unflinching loyalty .
obedience without question . loyalty till underverse come .
well done , vaako .
this is a day of days .
now , tell me if its true .
tell me the furyan is gone .
and i can close this campaign without hearing his bootsteps .
if he is dead .
i sense im not far from the same fate .
being of no further use here .
shouldnt i tell you that riddick is still alive .
dont try me , aereon .
i could plough you under with the rest of helion prime .
no one really knows the future .
then tell me the odds .
that vaako met with success .
that i will now be the one who can finish it all .
conquering or converting all the remaining worlds of man .
tell me its true , aereon .
and maybe ill save your home world .
for last .
the odds are good .
that riddick is still alive .
ascension protocol .
we still have numbers out there , lord marshal .
sweep teams , recon ships .
they would be hardpressed to make it back .
get my armada off the ground .
you mean on helion i mean here on this very ship .
could you be wrong .
mind fabricates fear . could you be wrong .
not so wrong as you when you left him alive .
its twice a mistake .
not only your failure , but now the report of success .
how do we salvage this how .
lord marshals got to be warned .
you will never see the underverse .
he will kill us both before our due time .
i say give riddick his chance .
if he is half of what you think .
he can at least wound the lord marshal .
and that is when you must act .
just to take his place just to keep what i kill .
that is the necromonger way .
it is not enough then you do it for the faith .
if he has fear , he has weakness .
if he has weakness , vaako .
he is unworthy of lordship .
we do it for all necromongers .
protect the faith .
this can still be a day of days .
but the timing must .
be flawless .
final protocol . execute on my order .
were done with this world .
go inside .
ziza , go inside .
we found this lensor dead .
show me his last sight .
commander toal .
he wont escape twice .
stay your weapons .
he came for me .
consider this .
if you fall here now .
youll never rise .
but if you choose another way .
the necromonger way .
go to him .
it hurts .
at first .
but after a while , the pain goes away , just as they promise .
are you with me , kyra .
theres a moment when you can almost see the underverse through his eyes .
he makes it sound perfect .
a place where anyone can start over .
are you with me , kyra .
convert now .
or fall forever .
you killed everything i know .
vaako .
not yet .
been a long time since ive seen my own blood .
these are his last moments .
give me your soul , furyan .
never .
you are not the one to bring me down .
now kill the beast while hes wounded .
help me , vaako .
kill him .
forgive me .
flawless .
i thought you were dead .
i was always with you .
i was .
you keep what you kill .
now , what would be the odds of that .
this dark army at the feet of a ione outlaw .
and the fate of the rest of the universe .
not even i dare to calculate that .
in order to effect a timely halt to deteriorating conditions .
and to ensure the common good , .
a state of emergency is declared for these territories .
by decree of lord cutler beckett , .
duly appointed representative of his majesty the king .
by decree according to martial law , .
the following statutes are temporarily amended: .
right to assembly: .
suspended .
right to habeas corpus: .
right to legal counsel: .
right to verdict by a jury of peers: .
by decree , all persons found guilty of piracy .
or aiding a person convicted of piracy .
or associating with a person convicted of piracy .
shall be sentenced to hang by the neck until death .
lord beckett .
theyve started to sing , sir .
finally .
for any who are ignorant of his meaning .
particularly a woman .
particularly a woman alone .
what makes you think shes alone .
you protect her .
and what makes you think i need protecting .
your masters expecting us .
and an unexpected death would cast a slight pall on our meeting .
have you heard anything from will .
i trust young turner to acquire the charts .
and you to remember your place in the presence of captain sao feng .
is he that terrifying .
hes much like myself , but absent my merciful nature and sense of fair play .
do you think because she is a woman we would not suspect her of treachery .
well , when you put it that way .
remove .
please .
captain barbosa , .
welcome to singapore .
more steam .
none of that . if things dont go the way they want , then were the only chance theyve got .
i understand that you have a request to make of me .
more of a proposal to put thee .
ive a venture underway , and i find myself in need of a ship and a crew .
its an odd coincidence .
because you happen to have a ship and a crew you dont need .
because earlier this day , no far from here , .
a thief broke into my most revered uncles temple .
and tried to make home with these .
the navigational charts .
the route to the farthest ticket .
wouldnt it be amazing if this venture of yours .
took you to the world beyond this one .
it would strain credulity , at that .
this is the thief .
is his face familiar to you .
then i guess .
he has no further need for it .
you come into my city .
and you betray my hospitality .
sao feng , i assure you , i had no idea .
that he would get caught .
you intend to attempt a voyage to davy jones locker .
but i cannot help but wonder .
the song has been sung .
the time is upon us .
we must convene the brethren court .
as one of the nine pirate lords .
you must honor the call .
there is a price on all our heads .
it is true .
and since the only way a pirate can turn a profit anymore .
is by betraying .
other pirates .
its the time to put our differences aside wait for the signal .
the first    .
now that rule is being challenged by lord cutler beckett .
against east india trading company , .
what value is the brethren court .
you can fight .
get off me .
you are sao feng , the pirate lord of singapore .
would you have that era come to an end on your watch .
the most notorious pirates from around the world .
are uniting against our enemy , .
and yet you sit here cowering in your bathwater .
elizabeth swann .
there is more to you than meets the eye , .
isnt there .
and the eye .
does not go wanting .
but i cannot help but notice .
you have failed to answer my question: .
what is it you seek in davy jones locker .
jack sparrow .
hes one of the pirate lords .
the only reason .
i would jack sparrow return from the land of the dead .
is so i can send him back myself .
jack sparrow holds one of the nine pieces of eight .
he failed to pass it along to a successor before he died .
so we must go and get him back .
so .
you admit .
you have deceived me .
weapons .
sao feng , i assure you , our intentions are strictly honorable .
drop your weapons .
or i kill the man .
kill him . hes not our man .
if hes not with you and hes not with us .
who is he with .
set , fire .
doublez   .
set .
its an odd coincidence , isnt it .
the east india trading company finds me the day you show up in singapore .
it is coincidence only .
if you want to make a deal with beckett , .
you need what i offer .
you crossed barbosa .
you are willing to cross jack sparrow .
why should i expect any better .
i need the black pearl to free my father .
youre helping me to get it .
thank you , jack .
you have the charts .
and better yet .
a ship with a crew .
wheres sao feng .
hell cover our escape and meet us in shipwreck cove .
hold it stiff into the wind .
theres no place left for sao feng to cower .
do you think he will honor the call .
i cannot say .
there is an evil and disease .
that even the most staunch and bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear .
a piece of eight .
nine of them , you say .
our new friend in singapore was very specific , sir .
nine pieces of eight .
whats the significance of that , i wonder .
does it matter .
nothing can hold against the armada . not even the flying dutchman , i believe .
nothing we know of .
did your friend happen to mention where the brethren court are meeting .
he was mum on that , sir .
then he knows the value of information .
better keep this between ourselves .
we dont want anyone running off to singapore , do we .
ah , admiral .
you summoned me , lord beckett .
yes . something for you there .
your new station deserves an old friend .
not more requisition orders .
no sir .
execution .
the brethren know they face extinction .
all that remains is for them to decide where they make their final stand .
no one said anything about cold .
im sure there must be a good reason for our suffering .
why dont that   woman just bring jack back , .
the same way she brought back barbosa .
because barbosa was only dead .
jack sparrow is taken in body and soul .
to a place not of death .
but punishment .
the worst fate a person can bring upon himself .
stretching on forever .
thats what awaits in davy jones locker .
i mean , that was a good reason .
nothing here is said .
it is hardly as accurate as modern charts . no .
but it leads to more places .
over the edge .
over again .
sunrise sets flash of green .
do you care to interpret , .
ever gazed upon the green flash , master gibbs .
i reckon ive seen my fair share .
happens on rare occasion , .
at the last glimpse of sunset , a green flash shoots up into the sky .
some go their whole lives without ever seeing it .
some claimed to have seen it who aint . and some say .
it signals when a soul comes back to this world .
from the dead .
sorry .
trust me , young master turner , .
its not getting to the land of the dead thats the problem .
its getting back .
back to  lift the sail aye , aye , sir .
bloody hell , theres nothing left .
jones is a loose cannon , sir .
fetch the chest .
and the governour .
hes been asking questions about the heart .
does he know .
then perhaps his usefulness has run its course .
steady , men .
all of you .
and take that infernal thing with you .
i will not have it on my ship .
oh , im sorry to hear that .
because i will .
because it seems to me the only way to ensure .
that this ship do as directed by the company .
we need prisoners to interrogate , .
which tends to work best when theyre alive .
the dutchman sails as its captain commands .
and its captain is to sail it as commanded .
i would have thought youd learned that when i had ordered you to kill your pet .
this is no longer your world , jones .
the immaterial .
charge .   .
how long will we continue not talking .
once we rescue jack , everything will be fine .
then we rescue jack .
there is a cost must be payed in the end .
barbosa .
ahead .
aye , were good and lost now .
lost .
for certain you have to be lost to find a place as cant be found .
elseways everyone would know where it was .
were gaining speed aye .
to stations .
all hands to stations .
haul the   away .
never lay down .
let her run straight   .
blimey .
were doomed , thats all .
dont be so unkind .
you may not survive to pass this way again .
and these are the last friendly words youll hear .
all to port .
.
, slack em braces .
aye , captain .
slack em braces .
step loudly   .
down below .
help   ye filthy toads .
.
aye ,   sir .
mr sparrow aye , captain .
what say you about the condition of this tackon .
it be proper to my eye , sir .
proper .
it is neither proper nor suitable , sir , it is not acceptable , nor adequate , .
it is an obvious fact .
an abomination .
begging your pardon , sir , but perhaps if you gave a man another chance .
shall i .
that sort of thinking got us into   mess .
we have lost speed , and therefore time .
precious time , .
which cannot be recovered once lost .
do you understand aye , aye , captain .
do you now it will all have to be redone .
all of it .
and let this serve as a lesson to the lot of you .
doldrum , sir , .
has the entire crew on edge .
i have no sympathy for any of you feculant maggots , .
and no more patience to pretend otherwise .
gentlemen , i wash my hands of this weirdness .
no wind .
of course theres no bloody wind .
my soul , i do swear for the place .
gust , whisper , .
tiny miniature lick .
yes sir , i know , but why why would he do that .
because hes a lummox , isnt he .
we shall have a magnificent garden party , .
and youre not invited , .
a rock .
now were being followed by rocks . never heard that before .
oh a rope .
this truly is a godforsaken place .
i dont see jack .
i dont see anyone .
davy jones never once gave up that what he took .
and does it matter .
were trapped here by your doing . no different than jack .
witty jack is closer than you think .
impossible .
slap me thrice n hand me to me momma its jack .
its the captain   sword .
jack mr gibbs .
aye , captain i thought so .
i expect youre able to account for your actions then .
there has been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline on my vessel why .
why is that , sir .
sir , youre youre in davy jones locker , captain .
i know that .
i know where i am . and dont think i dont .
ah , hector . its been too long , hasnt it .
aye . illy doo mooahrtay , remember .
you shot me .
no i didnt .
tia dalma out and about , aye .
you add an agreeable sense of macabre to any delirium .
he thinks were a hallucination .
william , tell me something .
have you come because you need my help to save a certain distressing damsel , .
or rather damsel distress .
either one .
well , then you wouldnt be here , would you .
so you cant be here .
q.e.d . , youre not really here .
jack .
this is real . were here .
weve come to rescue you .
oh , youre not .
very kind of you .
but it would seem that as i possess a ship and you dont , .
youre the ones in need of rescuing , .
and im not sure as im in the mood .
i see my ship .
right there .
cant spot it .
must be a tiny little thing , hiding somewhere behind the pearl .
jack , cutler beckett has the heart of davy jones .
he controls the flying dutchman . hes taking over the seas .
the song has already been sung .
the brethren court is called .
leave you people alone for just a minute , look what happens everythings gone to pot .
aye , jack , the world needs you back   .
and you need a crew .
why should i sail with any of you .
four of you have tried to kill me in the past . one of you succeeded .
oh shes not told you .
youll have loads to talk about while youre here .
as for you .
now , dont tell me you didnt enjoy it the other day .
fair enough all right , you lady .
dont need you . you scare me .
what gives , you can come . marty .
cotton .
parrot   at least ill have someone to talk to .
who are you tai huang .
these are my men .
i have a ship .
that makes you the highest bidder .
good man .
anchor . all hands , prepare to make sail .
which way are you going , jack .
what are you doing what are you doing .
no , what are you doing .
what are you doing .
the captain gives orders on the ship .
the captain of this ship is giving orders .
my ship , makes me captain .
they be my charts .
that makes you chartman .
stow away .
dont move you thats an order understand .
sorry .
i just thought , with the captain issue and all , id throw in my name for consideration .
id vote for you . yes .
you left jack to the kraken .
hes rescued now . its done with .
will , i had no choice .
you chose not to tell me .
i couldnt .
it wasnt your burden to bear .
well , i did bear it , didnt i .
i just didnt know what it was .
i thought .
you thought i loved him .
if you make your choices alone , .
how can i trust you .
you cant .
eerie .
thats downright macabree .
i wonder what would happen if you dropped a cannonball on one of them .
be disrespectful , you would .
they should be in the care of davy jones .
that was the duty im was charged with .
by the goddess calypso , .
to ferry those who die at sea to the other side .
and every ten years , .
im could come ashore .
to be with she o love im .
truly .
but the man has become a monster .
so he wasnt always tentacly .
im was a man .
once .
now theres boats coming .
theyre not a threat to us .
am i right .
we are nothing but ghosts to them .
weve better as just let them be .
its my father weve made it back .
father father , im up here .
elizabeth .
were not back .
are you dead .
i think i am .
no , you cant be .
there was this chest , .
you see .
i thought .
at the time it seemed so important .
come on board .
and a heart .
i learnt that if you stab the heart , .
yours must take its place , .
and you will sail the seas for eternity .
the dutchman must have a captain .
silly thing to die for .
someone cast a line .
come back with us .
i told you , im destiny .
take the line .
i was so proud of you , elizabeth .
she must not leave the ship father .
please come with us please dont leave me .
ill give your love to your mother , shall i .
i wont let you go elizabeth .
he made peace .
rums gone , too .
if we cannot escape these doldrums .
before night , .
i fear we will sail .
on trackless seas , .
doomed to   between worlds forever .
with no water , forever looks to be arriving a mite too soon .
why doesnt he do something .
me eye give it back .
theres no sense to it .
and the green flash happens at sunset .
not sunrise .
god , driving me over the blooming edge .
sunrises dont set .
up is down .
well , thats just maddeningly unhelpful .
why are these things never clear .
clear as mud , jacky . what .
stab the heart . dont stem the heart .
come again .
the dutchman must have a captain .
well , thats even more than less than unhelpful .
sail the seas for eternity .
i love the sea . what about port .
i prefer rum .
rums good .
making port , .
where we can get rum and salty wenches .
once every ten years .
what did you say .
ten years is a long time , mate .
even longer , given the deficit of rum .
but eternity is longer still .
and how will you be spending it .
dead or not .
the immortal captain sparrow .
well , id love that .
come sunset , it wont matter .
sundown and rise .
up .
what do you think .
where .
there .
what is it .
were rocking the ship .
aye , hes on to it .
hes rocking the ship .
we tie each other to the mast upside down , so when the boat flips well be the right way up .
swell .
loose the cannons , you   .
unstow the cargo .
let it surf .
now up .
is down .
blessed sweet westerlies .
were back .
theres the sunrise .
we need our pistols . get untied , alright .
alright then .
the brethren court has a gathering at shipwreck cove , .
and jack , you and i are agoing , and therell be no arguing that point .
i is arguing the point .
if these pirates are gathering , im pointing my ship the other way .
the pirates are gathering to fight beckett , and youre a pirate .
fight or not , youre not running , jack .
if we dont stand together , theyll hunt us down one by one , till there be none left but you .
quite like the sound of it .
captain jack sparrow .
the last pirate .
aye , and youll be fighting jones alone .
how does that figure into your plan .
im still working on that .
but i will not be going back to the locker , nay .
count on that .
why , we can still use them as clubs .
effective , though .
theres a freshwater spring on this island .
we can resupply there and get back to shooting each other later .
you lead the shore party . ill stay with my ship .
im not leaving my ship in your command .
why dont you both go ashore and leave the ship in my command .
temporarily .
criminy .
odds bodkins .
careful careful .
you stupid fish actually , its a cephalopod .
youre right . i bet people will pay a shilling to see this .
and another shilling for a sketch from seeing it drop .
slayers .
we could   a slice as a souvenir .
still thinking of running , jack .
think you can outrun the world .
you know , the problem .
with being the last of anything .
by and by , therell be none left at all .
sometimes things come back , mate .
were living proof , you and me .
aye , but thats a gamble of luck now , aint it .
theres never a guarantee of coming back .
passing on , thats dead certain .
summoning the brethren court then , is it .
its our only hope left .
thats a sad commentary in and of itself .
the world used to be a bigger place .
the worlds still the same .
theres just less in it .
poisoned . fouled by the body .
aye , i know him he was in singapore .
singapore .
we got company .
hes the captain .
sao feng you showing up here , .
it is truly a remarkable coincidence .
you paid me great insult once .
that doesnt sound like me .
so we just call it square then .
release her .
shes not part of the bargain .
and what bargain be that .
you heard captain turner .
release her .
captain turner aye , the perfidious rotter lead a mutiny against us .
i need the pearl to free my father .
thats the only reason i came on this voyage .
why didnt you tell me you were planning this .
that was my burden to bear .
he needs the pearl captain turner needs the pearl .
and you felt guilty .
and you and your brethren court .
did no one come to save me just because they missed me .
im standing over there with him .
im sorry , jack .
but there is an old friend who wants to see you first .
im not certain i can survive any more visits from old friends .
if youre so jealous to find out .
curious .
your friends appear to be quite desperate , jack .
perhaps they no longer believe that a gathering of squabbling pirates can defeat the flying dutchman .
and so despair leads to betrayal .
but you and i are no strangers to betrayal , .
are we .
its not here , jack .
what what isnt .
the heart of davy jones . its safely aboard the dutchman , .
and so unavailable for you sirs leverage to satisfy your debt to the good captain .
by my reckoning , that account has been settled .
by your death .
and yet here you are .
close your eyes and pretend its all a bad dream . thats how i get by .
and if davy jones were to learn of your survival .
on your guard , men .
my men are crew enough .
company ship , company crew .
he agreed . the black pearl was to be mine .
and so it was .
perhaps you consider an alternative arrangement .
one which requires absolutely nothing from you .
but information .
regarding the brethren court no doubt .
in exchange for fair compensation .
square my debt with jones , .
guarantee my freedom .
of course . its just good business .
were i in a divulgeatory mood , .
what then might i divulge .
everything .
where are they meeting .
who are the pirate lords .
what is the purpose of the nine pieces of eight .
beckett agreed . the black pearl wants to be mine .
lord becketts not gonna give up the only ship as can outrun the dutchman , is he .
shame that youre not bound to honor the code of the brethren , isnt it .
because honors a hard thing to come by nowadays .
there is no honor to remain  with the losing side .
leaving it for the winning side .
is just good business .
the losing side , you say .
they have the dutchman .
now the pearl .
and what do the brethren have .
we have calypso .
calypso .
an old legend .
the goddess herself , bound in human form .
imagine all the power as you see is brought to bear against our enemy .
i intend to release her , .
but for that i need the brethren court .
all the court .
then keep barbosa , .
the belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye , both , .
and turner .
especially turner .
the rest go with me aboard the pearl , and ill lead you to shipwreck cove , .
where i will hand you the pirates , and you will not hand me to jones .
bloody fair deal , dont you think .
and what becomes of miss swann .
what interest is she to you .
what are you proposing , captain .
what be accepted captain .
the girl .
ive just recalled ive got this wonderful compass , .
which points to whatever i want .
so for what do i need you .
elizabeth is not part of any bargain .
it was not a question .
point you to the thing you want most and that is not the brethren court , is it .
then what is , jack .
dead .
you got us into this mess . if this is what frees us , then done .
although if i kill you , then i can use the compass to find shipwreck cove , is it .
on my own .
cut out the middleman , as it were .
elizabeth , they are pirates .
i have had more than enough experience dealing with pirates .
then we have an accord .
with me killed , youd arrive at the cove .
to find its a stronghold nigh impregnable , .
able to withstand blockade for years , .
and then youd be wishing , .
oh , if only there were someone i had not killed .
inside , to ensure that the pirates then come outside .
and you can accomplish all this , can you .
you may kill me , but you may never insult me .
who am i .
im captain jack sparrow .
by this time tomorrow , we will arrive at shipwreck cove , and you will be free .
not a name you fancy , id imagine , out of the many that you have .
but it is what we call you .
we being who .
you confirm it .
confirm what .
youve told me nothing . the brethren court , not i .
the first brethren court whose decision i would have opposed .
they bound you to human form so the rule of the seas .
would belong to man and not to me .
but one such as you should never be anything less than what you are .
pretty speech from a captor .
but words whispered through prison bars lose their charm .
can i be blamed for my efforts .
all men are drawn to the sea , perilous though it may be .
and some men offer desire as justification for their crimes .
i offer simply my desire .
and in return .
i would have your gifts , should you choose to give them .
and if i should choose .
not .
then i will take .
your fury .
sao feng .
come here . please .
with all nine pieces of eight , .
you will be free .
you are captain now .
go on my place to shipwreck cove .
forgive me , calypso .
what did he tell you .
he made me captain .
you are not my captain .
james .
your father will be overjoyed to know youre safe .
my father is dead .
no , that cant be true . he returned to england .
did lord beckett tell you that .
who among you do you name as captain .
captain her .
captain tow the ship .
put the prisoners in the brig .
the captain shall have my quarters . thank you , sir .
but i prefer to remain with my crew .
i swear i did not know .
know what .
which side you chose .
well , now you do .
you know my name .
yes . i know your son .
will turner .
he made it .
hes alive .
and now he sends you to tell me that hes coming to get me .
godswoons , hes on his way .
yes , will is alive .
and he wants to help you .
he cant help me .
he wont come .
but youre his father .
i know you .
he spoke of you .
he cant save me .
he cant come because of you .
youre elizabeth .
yes , im elizabeth .
if jones be slain , he who slays him must take his place .
captain forever .
the dutchman must always have a captain .
and if he saves me , .
he loses you .
you wont pick me .
i wouldnt pick me .
tell him not to come .
tell him to stay away .
tell him its too late .
im already a part of the ship .
and the crew .
bootstrap .
yes , i knew your son .
hes coming for me .
wait and see .
youll see .
he promised .
sir .
a breadcrumb trail , and we are meant to follow .
a betrayer among them .
or a trap .
a gambit by a skilled opponent .
adjust course , lieutenant .
we can only hope to reach our destination .
before they run out of bodies .
you escaped the brig even quicker than i expected .
do you notice anything .
rather , .
do you notice something that is not there to be noticed .
you havent raised an alarm .
odd , isnt it .
not as odd as this .
come up with this all by you alone , did you .
i said to myself: think like jack .
this is what youve arrived at .
leave beckett the shipwreck cove so as to gain his trust , .
accomplish your own ends .
its like you dont know me at all , mate .
and how does your dearly beloved feel about this plan .
youve not seen fit to trust her with this .
im losing it , jack .
every step i make for my father is a step away from elizabeth .
mate , if you choose to love your heart away , youll lose it for certain .
if i might lend a machete to your intellectual thicket , .
why , the choice is all to give up .
changes effects .
let someone else dispatch jones .
you .
death has a curious way of reshuffling ones priorities .
ill slip aboard the dutchman , find the heart , stab the beating thing , your father goes free from his debt .
youre free to be with your charming murderess .
and youre willing to cut out your heart and bind yourself to the dutchman .
forever .
no , mate . im free forever .
free to sail the seas beyond the edges of the map . free from death itself .
youll have to do the job though , jack .
youll have to ferry souls to the next world .
or end up just like jones .
i dont have the face for tentacles .
but a mortal has to care for something , aye .
whats this for .
a thing like me . itll come to you .
my regards to davy jones .
i hate him .
come with me .
quickly .
do not go to shipwreck cove .
beckett knows of the meeting of the brethren .
i fear there may be a traitor among them .
its too late to own my forgiveness .
i had nothing to do with your fathers death .
that does not absolve me of my other sins .
come with us .
james , come with me .
who goes there .
i will follow .
youre lying .
our destinies have been entwined , elizabeth .
but never joined .
go now .
back to your station , sailor .
no one leaves the ship .
stand down . thats an order .
thats an order .
part of the crew , part of the ship .
part of the crew , part of the ship steady , man .
part of the crew , part of the ship who runs prisoner escapes .
relay that .
day after day .
the store that one might .
i hate television . it gives me headaches .
theres so many magnetic waves traveling in the airspace .
because of tv and television , were losing .
10 times as many brain cells as were supposed to .
oh , please .
the cow says blank .
three letters .
dude .
i dont know . magnetic waves , brain cells .
i dont understand the connection between that stuff .
you know what else i heard .
magnetic waves shrink silicone molecules .
oh , my god turn it off .
its not working .
its backwards .
what do we do i dont know .
that was kind of scary .
i know something even scarier . what .
have you heard about this videotape .
where they do it on the boat and then in the car .
and then in the bathtub .
hes like , baby , i love you . and shes like , where are we .
and did you see the no .
not that tape . oh .
the one with all the scary images .
after you watch the tape , the phone rings .
and this scary voice comes on and says youre gonna die in .
seven days . i saw that one with josh last weekend .
you were with josh last weekend .
oh , yes , i was .
oh , you ho .

call it womens intuition or espn or both .
but i can tell when dangers near .

some old tupac , sir .
all eyez on me . hey , this shit is banging .
thank you , sir . i appreciate it .
hello , cindy .
i am the architect .
you have many questions .
ive been watching you for a very long time .
so i see .
what is the connection between the crop circles and the tape .
the answer is simple .
you are the eventuality of an anomaly .
you are inexorably seeking a sedulant probability .
sedulant .
grotesquerie no .
what about contingent affirmation .
thats got to mean something . hey .
hey you put cameras in my bathroom .
oh , my god . well , it was a long winter .
this is an invasion of ow .
oh , sorry .
i cant help it . its very ionely in here .
ergo , i havent been with anyone in a very long time , .
or this chair .
i call her .
linda .
could you just cut to the chase im kind of in a rush .
why you can always sleep over if you want .
lindas built for two , and she vibrates .
stop it just tell me what i need to know .
who is that little girl .
okay , okay .
my wife and i wanted a child , but she couldnt get pregnant .
neither could i .
so you adopted .
we loved our daughter , but she was evil .
made the horses crazy , killed our puppies , .
hid the remote .
really sick shit .
my wife took her to the old family farm .
and drowned her in the well .
i felt a simple timeout would have been sufficient .
but tabitha imprinted her evil on a videotape .
i never meant for it to get out , but .
but what .
i put it in the wrong box and returned it to blockbuster , .
instead of my copy of pootie tang .
its been circulating and killing ever since .
just like pootie tang .
but what does this have to do with aliens .
perhaps tabithas summoning them to kill us all .
an alien invasion .
i have to warn the world .
its already begun . youre too late .
but not too late to make an old man happy .
what .
and now reports of lights in the sky .
glimpses of spacecraft .
possible alien sightings being reported all over the world .
are they aliens .

the duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours .
this is the scroll of the buddhist palm . its priceless .
but as its fate , ill let you have it for $ 10 .
buddhist palm manual .

memories can be painful . to forget may be a blessing .
i never knew you were so deep .

ill slap you to kingdom come .
look at those foureyes carting around a coffin .
what morons .
dont blame me for making you leave .
well let buddha decide .
whether you stay .
or go .
horrifically bad fate .
have some tea .
were grateful for some professional help .
we understand the problem . twelve kicks from the tam school .
iron fist from the hung school and the hexagon staff .
those guys at pig sty are really good .
their warrior days are long over .
but theyre still top fighters .
this job is a great challenge for us .
now , thats professionalism .
number one killers . expensive , yes , but worth every penny .
number one is the beast , the worlds top killer .
he was so dedicated to kung fu , he went crazy .
i heard hes now in an asylum .
so youre the top killers now .
strictly speaking , were just musicians .
a song that wrenches the heart o where do i find a knowing ear .
great poem , isnt it .
well be saying goodbye soon .
who knows when well see each other again .
were three of a kind . wish wed known before .
lets take this opportunity to spar a little .
no . we still have a lot to pack .
youre right .
twelve kicks of the tam school superb attack and defense .
iron fist: powerful yet delicate . topnotch .
hexagon staff , with its thousand moves . mystical .
till we meet again .
more lipstick .
stay there , or ill break you in half .
sorry , were closed .
you can make a suit in no time .
were moving .
this is good material .
you know your stuff .
this has high artistic value .
how high .
at least a few stories .
insulting the axe gang well show them .
lets kill them all and make this place a brothel .
dont block my view .
whats going on .
damn i told those nitwits to leave , but theyre still here .
really yeah .
what the hell is this fighting wholl pay for the damage .
sorry , sorry . its nothing .
you know what time it is i have to sleep .
hey , fatso , eat shit and die .
die in this racket .
sorry , sorry .
get out of my way .
hang in there , tailor .
be quiet .
give us a break why push us so far .
theres another master .
its the lions roar .

thats the last well see of them .
its bad , brother sum . quick , start the car .
start the car .
keep it down have you no manners .
get lost . people are trying to sleep .
they have to work tomorrow . get out of here .
scumbags .
i cant hang on much longer .
but having seen real masters like you .
i can now die in peace .
dont say that .
were ordinary folks .
ordinarys a blessing .
dont call us masters .
but youre such great fighters .
if only youd helped earlier , they wouldnt have to die this way .
like donut said , everyone has his reasons .
years ago .
we saw our only son killed in a fight .
revenge can be devastating .
do you understand .
why dont you train us to be top fighters .
and well avenge them .
becoming a top fighter takes time .
unless youre a naturalborn kungfu genius .
and theyre one in a million .
its obvious im the one .
dont think so .
everyone we swore wed never fight again .
but we broke that promise today .
for your own safety , please all leave .
in great power lies great responsibility .
theres no escaping from it .
donut , youre hurt bad .
rest now .
we cant understand what youre saying .
i know you , foureyes .
you seem prejudiced against the sightchallenged .
thats right . especially goldframed foureyes .
gold frames are perfect for clerks .
i think i look good . so why keep picking on me .
help me help me want to play , punks .
the dragon style the tiger style .
come down here , and ill smash your glasses . come on .
you know id do it , right .
swear to it .
swear .
have you no respect where were you when i needed you .
you sound like a wimp .
we always get beat we havent gotten anywhere .
no killing , no arson , no robberies , no rapes .
all because of you .
youre a numbnut .
follow me .
its a stickup wheres the money .
wheres the money .
whatre you looking at im serious .
i kill people for less give me the money .
the moneys in here .
let go of the girl .
hes a fool , and shes mute . losers .
go away youre dragging me down .
go home and raise pigs .
go , before i kill you .
you whatsyourname .
take this and get some new clothes . youre now an axe .
for real someones waiting for you .
one look at you , and i knew youd do anything .
you just needed your chance .
damn right .
weve an assignment for you .
anything , brother sum .
research on abnormal people . whats that .
a mental asylum .
soldiers .
boy scouts .
tanks .
no worries .
when the boy scouts change shifts , you have exactly five minutes .
follow the arrows on the map . go to the last cell .
and get the man inside there out . heres your tools .
what about you guys .
were your lookouts .
five minutes . hurry .
the worlds top killer indeed looks the part .
its only a title .
cut the bullshit . we want two people killed . name your price .
name my what .
ive killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary .
so far , ive never found one .
thats why i stayed inside .
had i met my match , id have been out long ago .
if you find me a worthy opponent .
ill do it for free . no charge .
do you have someone .
yes . brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge .
but first , will you show us some moves .
not that we dont trust you . we want to see you in action .
you numskulls arent worthy .
he doesnt look the part .
the slippers are a little crappy . but hell clean up well .
you sure you got the right guy .
absolutely . i swear i did exactly what you told me .
please show us some moves , mr . beast . dont make it hard for me .
you dumb or what .
you know what this is , old man .
ever seen a fist this big .
dont force me to fight . i scare myself when i fight .
really try me , then .
is he okay .
so you say you can fight .
harder .
you hit like that and call yourself a gangster .
a foreign gun .
in the world of kung fu , speed defines the winner .
the beast is the best of them all .
the axe gang extends its respect .
the real masters , together in one room .
only the worlds top killer .
has such an aura .
likewise .
could you two be the fated lovers .
paris .
and helen of troy .
a pleasure , indeed .
were here to deal with the axe gang .
and only the axe gang .
you shouldve killed me before .
now youre committing suicide .
youre living on borrowed time .
you cant escape your fate .
whats this a funeral bell .
with the beast here , lets see whose funeral it is .
so youre on their side .
dont get me wrong .
i only want to kill you .
or be killed by you .
what do you think .
the good cannot coexist with the bad . you cant escape your destiny .
so be it . lets do it .
lets do it .
piece of cake . i can handle this .
good try , but a little off target .
the lions roar .
i didnt know the lions roar could be done with a speaker .
what a blow .
looks like theyre not up to it lets get them while theyre down .
im gonna puke i need to see a doctor go to hell .
you come over here .
hit him yes .
the head of course .
heres your chance . got it .
hit him hit him .
hit the shit out of him right .
beat the shit out of him .
whatre you doing .
you want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him .
youre making me very confused .
wow , thats a big fist .
why did you hit me .
where are they .
how could you let them escape .
no one gets away from me .
why did he save us .
young people make mistakes .
but at least he finally made good .
look at him beaten to a pulp .
do you have any last requests .
hey , wait .
why dont you write in chinese i dont understand .
theres no one here .
chinese medicine .
its a miracle he lasted this long .
the herbs should help him .
herbal medicine can only partly help . the key is his own body structure .
all his bones and tendons are broken .
its amazing hes recovering so fast .
it cant be possible .
unless hes .
whats that smell .
you mustnt smoke while youre hurt .
let me handle this .
this makes no sense .
who knew the beast could clear the chi flow .
and thus unleash the boys true potential .
we shouldve guessed .
he is the one .
is this for real .
youre still alive , you turncoat .
what kind of move is that .
kids stuff .
if our son were alive , hed be his age now .
if he studies hard , he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer .
a stuntman , more likely .
not bad . lets go .
i can even stop bullets .
what the toad style of the kwan lun school .
oh , no .
remember the palm move that falls from heaven .
thats the long lost buddhist palm .
what kind of move was that .
if you want to learn , ill teach you .
master .
hey tell him not to put snot on the glass .
you two , put your pants on .

jim stopped and he sees me on wednesday morning , right before. .
wednesday yes .
and he seemed very anxious , like he was not quite sure of things. .
and he kept talking about you , and the girls , and he said that. .
no matter what happen , he wanted to make sure you are all okay. .
and then he tripled his death benefit .
i mean , it is on no problem .
the police reports all confirm that it was an accident , so. .
i will just get this clear to the main office . and , um , i should have a check for you very soon .
nice view , huh .
yes , very .
you have a family .
i have two daughters , but , um. .

linda. .
it has been a long time .
i am scared , father .
1632 , a dutch trading company move off the coast of carolina. .
a hysterical woman claimed. .
to have walked through the aftermath of a terrible hurricane that have not happen yet .
so , what happened .
they hung her for being a witch .
two days later , the entire town was wiped out by a force of hurricane .
it is awful .
let us get ahead to the 20th century .
boston , 1918 .
at the height of the influence of epidermis .
a father told a friend he has been to the future. .
he has seen a grave of a two small children .
the autopsy showed that the children were never infected .
he shot himself a week later .
who are these people , why did it happen .
you see. .
history is full of unexplained phenomena. .
nobody knows why .
some people thought , they suffered from what the ancients called. .
blasphemer absence fades .
the dangers of the fatales .
the fatales .
even spiritual .
people who have lost their belief. .
they are like empty vessels .
they are more susceptible of having their life taken over by a force that is bigger than they are .
it is almost like a curse .
or a miracle .
yeah , but i do not believe in miracles .
every day , we are alive can be a miracle .
i do not feel that right , not for me .
something bad is going to happen .
i need your help , i need your direction. .
i need faith .
faith , it just believes something behind you. .
something you cannot feel , or smell , or touch. .
like hope . or love. .
i believe i have let that all go .
maybe you should try to get it back again , huh .
but if it is too late .
it is never too late to realize what is important in your life. .
to fight for it .
i do not know what to fight for .
